Germany's GDP grew slightly more, but the USA and China are in their own category in the absolute GDP growth. The financial crisis in 2008-2009 shows up in the USA's GDP and slightly also for Germany and Mexico, but not nearly as pronounced. For other countries included, there is no clear sign of it. Percentage-wise increase compared to the beginning of the dataset makes it clear that even for Zimbabwe, there was a change in GDP, just not at the same scale as for the others. Percentage-wise, the growth has been fastest for China, as its GDP in 2015 was more than eight times that of 2000. In Chile, the GDP growth also exceeded 200%, but in all of the other countries included, it is below that. In Chile, Germany, and Mexico, there is a decrease in 2009, while in Zimbabwe, it was already in 2008. For China and the USA, no percentage-wise decrease in GDP is observed, even though for the USA, there is a decrease in the absolute values."

With a GDP higher than that there seems to be two different lines of correlation, with the life expectancy increasing at different rates with respect to GDP growth. We can see that for Zimbabwe the correlation is linear as the GDP has stayed zero the whole time, but we'll plot the linear regressions for other countries to check how well they fit into the data."

The life expectancy has had a positive trend, apart from a minimum for Zimbabwe around 2004. \n",
